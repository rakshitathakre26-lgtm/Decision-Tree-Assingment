        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a machine learning model that makes decisions by asking a series of questions, just like how we make decisions in real life.\n",
        "\n",
        "It looks like an inverted tree:\n",
        "\n",
        "Root node → first question\n",
        "\n",
        "Branches → possible answers\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaf nodes → final decision (class label)\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ How it works in classification\n",
        "\n",
        "In classification, the goal is to predict a category (like “spam or not spam”, “diabetic or not”, “apple or orange”).\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree works in these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start at the root\n",
        "\n",
        "It begins with the whole dataset and picks the best feature to split the data.\n",
        "Example: For predicting if a fruit is “Apple” or “Orange”, the first question could be:\n",
        "“Is the color orange?”\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Split into branches\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the answer (“Yes” or “No”), the data is divided into groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Continue asking questions\n",
        "\n",
        "Each group is further split based on another best feature (like weight, size, texture).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Reach the leaf node\n",
        "\n",
        "When the tree cannot be split further, it decides the final class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If color = orange → Orange\n",

        "Entropy / Information Gain\n",
        "\n",
